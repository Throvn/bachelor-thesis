# Next Steps
A short todo list on what needs to be accomplished in the next 6 days.
The order of the points does matter and acts as priority.


## The paper:

1. [ ] Frame the story, like: Currently people don't use XY to evaluate DAOs, that could lead to distorted results. We test a detailed approach and compare whether this approach is valid or needs further research/ our solution to justify DAO selection.
2. [ ] Make stronger points in the theory and methodologies particularly add:
	1. __Expand this list whenever you have a thought__
3. [ ] Define that an "active" DAO is not only one which has snapshot proposals but shows no stagnation or falldown.


## The code:

1. [ ] Add Checkpoints
2. [ ] Fix MPS out of memory error:
	```
	RuntimeError: MPS backend out of memory (MPS allocated: 462.00 MB, other allocations: 17.60 GB, max allowed: 18.13 GB). Tried to allocate 144.38 MB on private pool. Use PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0 to disable upper limit for memory allocations (may cause system failure).
	```
3. [ ] Classify more DAOs
4. [ ] Train the model again
5. [ ] Make the classification completely offline servable
